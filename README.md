### Mostly automatic installation

`$ react-native link react-native-voiceit`

## Local Installation 
Firstly, to use the SDK locally, please clone the repo and drag it into your root React Native project. In the Package.json, replace to "react-native-voiceit": "file:./VoiceIt2-React-Native-SDK"

#### Android 
Get the <a href="https://github.com/voiceittech/VoiceIt2-AndroidSDK#local-installation"> Android-SDK</a> locally by doing the following: 

<ul>
 <li> Clone the Android-SDK repo
 <li> Open your main android project/folder in android studio, and navigate to File -> New -> Import Module
 <li> Select the Android SDK repo that you just cloned. Check off the app module, only include the voiceit2 module
 <li> Navigate to you local VoiceIt2-React-Native-SDK Folder
 <li> In the android/build.gradle, add implementation project(path: ':voiceit2') under dependencies 
</ul>

#### IOS

Please navigate to the podfile of your main IOS folder, and replace to:
```
  pod 'react-native-voiceit', :path => '../VoiceIt2-React-Native-SDK'
  pod "VoiceIt2-IosSDK", :path => './VoiceIt2-IosSDK'
```



## Usage
```javascript
import {NativeModules} from 'react-native';
const Voiceit = NativeModules.Voiceit;

//  Initialize the VoiceIt Native Module
//  Voiceit.init("API_KEY","API_TOKEN",(res)=>{
//  console.log(res);
//  } ;

//  Call the methods with the same signature as the IOS/Android SDK. For instance
//  Voiceit.encapsulatedFaceEnrollment("USR_ID",(res)=>{
//  console.log(res);
//  });
```

#### Functions
Initialize the module as follows:
```
import {NativeModules} from 'react-native';
const Voiceit = NativeModules.Voiceit;
Voiceit.initVoiceIt("API_KEY","API_TOKEN",(res)=>{
console.log(res);
};
```
The React Native SDK wraps the IOS and Android SDKs, and hence the methods exposed are the same as those.
Please refer to the [The Android SDK](https://github.com/voiceittech/VoiceIt2-AndroidSDK)/[The IOS SDK](https://github.com/voiceittech/VoiceIt2-IosSDK) for complete method reference. For instance

```
voiceItModule.encapsulatedFaceVerification("USER_ID","CONTENT_LANGUAGE", LIVENESS_BOOLEAN, AUDIO_LIVENESS_BOOLEAN, (res)=>{
callback(res);
});
```
 
#### User Token 
 To initialize Voiceit Module with User token and not use your API key and token, first generate a user token: https://api.voiceit.io/#user-token-generation
 Initialize Voiceit by placing the generated user token in palce of the API Key, and leave the API token as blank: 
```
Voiceit.initVoiceIt("GENERATED_USER_TOKEN","",(res)=>{
console.log(res);
};
```
 
 #### Theme
 To set a theme color, please initialize the voiceit Object as follows:
 ```
Voiceit.initVoiceItWithTheme("API_KEY","API_TOKEN", "HEX_COLOR_VALUE"(res)=>{
console.log(res);
};
 ```
